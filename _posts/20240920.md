**Locally Weighted Regression** **(LOWESS)**



<u>What is Regression?</u>

Within the range of input features (x), determining or predicting the dependent variable (y).



<u>Why do we do 'locally' weighted regression?</u>

Although trends are typically nonlinear, up close, it can be interpreted linearly if data is observed locally. In order to see the trends of nonlinear/nonparametric graphs, it is best to see overall trends through LOWESS. 



<u>What are kernels?</u>

A kernel is a weighting function used in many non-parametric estimation techniques. In this case, we will use the kernels to weigh observation of the learning sample based on their distance from the predicted observation.



Here are the lists of common kernels that we will be using in the code below.

- The Exponential (Gaussian) Kernel
- The Tricubic Kernel
- The Epanechnikov Kernel
- The Quadratic Kernel

# Import dataset
data = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/dvasiliu/AAML/blob/main/Data%20Sets/mtcars.csv?raw=True')
```

```python
# Multiple features 
X = data.drop(columns=['model', 'mpg']).values
y = data['mpg'].values
```

```python
# Scale the attributes to compute distances
scaler = StandardScaler()
xscaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```



<u>Using Cdist</u> 

```python
many_in_many: BatchMatches = search(xscaled, xscaled,len(xscaled) , MetricKind.L2sq, exact=True)
```

In the code above, each car in the dataset is compared to each and every data points including itself. This creates a matrix including the squared L2 distance between car i and j. 

For each data point in xscaled (representing each car), the code computes the squared Euclidean (L2) distance to every data points including itself. 

```python
one_in_many: Matches = search(xscaled, xscaled[0], len(xscaled), MetricKind.L2sq, exact=True)
```

In this code, the first car (xscaled[0]) is compared to every other car in the dataset. xscaled[0] is used as the query and entire dataset xscaled is the search space. This creates a 1D vector with a length of number of cars. 

```python
dist = one_in_many.to_list()
distances = cdist(xscaled,xscaled,metric='Euclidean')
```

Using cdist, we can compute pairwise distances between all points (cars) in the dataset. 

Similar to above, 'dist' is a 1D vector that has the squared L2 distances between the first car and all cars, but distances is a 2D matrix that has  Euclidean distances between all cars. 

```python
# Gaussian Kernel
def Gaussian(x):
  return np.where(np.abs(x)>4,0,1/(np.sqrt(2*np.pi))*np.exp(-1/2*x**2))

kern = Gaussian
weights = kernel_function(distances,kern,tau=0.05)
```



```python
model = Ridge(alpha=0.001,max_iter=5000)
model.fit(np.diag(weights[:,0])@xscaled, np.diag(weights[:,0])@y)
```



```python
model.predict(xscaled[0].reshape(1,-1))
```

array([20.97295036])

```python
y[0]
```

21.0

This is a decent prediction with only 0.027 of error. However, we will be experimenting by using different kernels.



<u>Using various kernels, MSE,  KFold</u>

```python
class Kernel:
    @staticmethod
    def Gaussian(x):
        return np.where(np.abs(x) > 4, 0, 1 / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * np.exp(-0.5 * x**2))

    @staticmethod
    def Tricubic(x):
        return np.where(np.abs(x) > 1, 0, (1 - np.abs(x)**3)**3)

    @staticmethod
    def Epanechnikov(x):
        return np.where(np.abs(x) > 1, 0, 3 / 4 * (1 - np.abs(x)**2))

    @staticmethod
    def Quartic(x):
        return np.where(np.abs(x) > 1, 0, 15 / 16 * (1 - np.abs(x)**2)**2)
    
    @staticmethod
    def Cauchy(x):
        return 1 / (1 + x**2)
    
def calculate_distances(X):
    return cdist(X, X, metric='euclidean')
```

I have added Cauchy kernel because it is especially robust to outliers. It discounts distant points and it would be interesting to see how it behaves with this dataset.

    def predict(self, X_new):
        predictions = []
        for i in range(len(X_new)):
            test_point = X_new[i].reshape(1, -1)  
            test_distances = cdist(test_point, self.X_train, metric='euclidean').flatten()
            w = kernel_function(test_distances, self.kernel, self.tau)
            model = Ridge(alpha=self.regularization)
            W = np.diag(w)  
            X_weighted = W @ self.X_train
            y_weighted = W @ self.y_train
            model.fit(X_weighted, y_weighted)
            prediction = model.predict(test_point)
            predictions.append(prediction[0])  
        return np.array(predictions)
```

From this graph, we can see that most residuals are around zero. This signifies that the model has successfully captured the relationship between the features and the target variable. The predictions seem to be accurate since there are only small amount of differences between predicted and actual value. 

Also because the residuals do not show a clear trend, it is likely that the model did not miss significant trend in the dataset.

There is one outlier at the top right of the plot, meaning that the model has not performed well in that area or there was a notable part in the dataset that could have been addressed beforehand for its specialty.

```python
kf = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
mse_list = []

for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X_scaled):
    X_train_fold, X_test_fold = X_scaled[train_index], X_scaled[test_index]
    y_train_fold, y_test_fold = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    
    model = Lowess(kernel=Kernel.Cauchy, tau=0.15)
    model.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)
    y_pred_fold = model.predict(X_test_fold)
    mse_fold = mean_squared_error(y_test_fold, y_pred_fold)
    mse_list.append(mse_fold)

print(f"10-Fold Cross-Validated MSE: {np.mean(mse_list)}")
```

Mean Squared Error: 1216.443541997037 
10-Fold Cross-Validated MSE: 443.1395488926818

```python
param_grid = {'tau': np.linspace(0.01, 0.5, 10)}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(Lowess(), param_grid, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_tau = grid_search.best_params_['tau']
print(f"Best tau: {best_tau}")

best_model = Lowess(kernel=Kernel.Cauchy, tau=best_tau)
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
best_y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
best_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, best_y_pred)
print(f"Optimized Mean Squared Error: {best_mse}")
```

Best tau: 0.5

Now let's compare the performance of each kernel

```
kernels = {
    'Gaussian': Kernel.Gaussian,
    'Tricubic': Kernel.Tricubic,
    'Epanechnikov': Kernel.Epanechnikov,
    'Quartic': Kernel.Quartic,
    'Cauchy': Kernel.Cauchy
}

for kernel_name, kernel_function in kernels.items():
    mse_list = []
    print(f"Running cross-validation for kernel: {kernel_name}")
    
    for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X_scaled):
        X_train, X_test = X_scaled[train_index], X_scaled[test_index]
        y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
        model = KernelWeightedRidgeModel(kernel=kernel_function, tau=0.1, alpha=0.001, max_iter=5000)
        distances = calculate_distances(X_train)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train, distances)
        test_distances = cdist(X_test, X_train, metric='euclidean')
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test, test_distances)
        mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
        mse_list.append(mse)
    
    avg_mse = np.mean(mse_list)
    kernel_mse_results[kernel_name] = avg_mse

# Results
print("Comparison of Kernels Based on 10-Fold Cross-Validated MSE:")
for kernel_name, mse in kernel_mse_results.items():
    print(f"{kernel_name}: {mse:.4f}")
```

Comparison of Kernels Based on 10-Fold Cross-Validated MSE: 

Gaussian: 4855.9033 
Tricubic: 6398.6382 
Epanechnikov: 6399.3141 
Quartic: 6398.7581 
Cauchy: 789.5126

```python
# Visualize the results
plt.bar(kernel_mse_results.keys(), kernel_mse_results.values())
plt.xlabel('Kernel')
plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
plt.title('Kernel Comparison Based on 10-Fold Cross-Validation')

The first four bars are similar in height, especially the middle three, which means that they have similar performance. Cauchy shows a significant amount of decrease in mean squared error, signifying that it was likely that the dataset had a lot of distant values that was better not being accounted for. However, this dataset was small, so there needs to be further testing on it.
